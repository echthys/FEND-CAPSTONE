# FEND-CAPSTONE

## Description 

This project is for the Udacity Front End Nano Degree. The aim of the project is for a user to enter a location they are travelling to with the date they are leaving. If the date is within a week it will return the current forecast, if not it will return a predicted forecast. 


## Reference 

- [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create) - Used to get the weather data 
- [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html) - To get the coordinates that will be used with the weatherbit api
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) - To get an image of the location 

## Extra Functionality 

- Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
